GIT HUB

GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of some kind of a version control system. 
It lets developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code projects.
your code project can be open source by choosin public or can be a private project.


As an experienced coder already and strongly familiar with git commands and git hub use, i ll highlight some of the use cases below.

With GitHub, you can:

- Host repositories (public or private)

- Track changes to your code over time using commits and branches

- Collaborate with others using pull requests and code reviews

- Automate workflows with GitHub Actions

- Contribute to open-source projects

- Store documentation with your code for example READMe file


Creating & Initializing Repositories

Command	Description

git init	Initialize a local git repo
git clone <your link>	Clone a repo from GitHub

(we use - and | to create tables in readme)


The above commands are some of the most important for git hub usage. and are very crucial for developers to know .. it shows great learning
structure for WeThinkCode_ to actually start here.
